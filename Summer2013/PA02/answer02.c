/*
 * Please fill the functions in this file.

 * For this assignment, you must use qsort and give appropriate

 *
 * You can assume that the input files have no empty lines and the
 * last line ends with '\n'.  You can count the number of lines by
 * counting the occurrences of '\n'.
 *
 * Hint: 
 * You can write additonal functions.

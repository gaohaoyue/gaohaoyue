This assignment asks you to write a program that can

* count the amounts of data stored in files by counting the number
  of the newline '\n' characters
* allocate memory based on the number of lines of the input file
* read the files and store the data in the allocated memory
* order the data by calling the qsort function in the C library
* save the sorted data into a file

For a file storing strings, you can assume that the length of each
line does not exceed LINELENGTH.  However, your program does not know
the number of lines in a file.

It is possible that two different lines in the same input file have
the same value (or the same word).

You must not allocate a large amount of memory before reading a file.
The amount of memory allocated by your program must depend on the size
of the file.  If your program allocates a large amount of memory that
is independent of the input file's size, you will receive zero in this
assignment.

You need to use valgrind to check whether your program has invalid
memory access or memory leak.
